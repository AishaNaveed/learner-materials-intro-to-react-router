# Activity 3 - 

## Confession Page

Here's the design for this page:

![Confess To Us](./images/confess.png "Sketched confession page")

Well, that's pretty surprising.

## Form Elements

It looks like they want a form with three elements. 

* A subject line for the confession.

* A dropdown for the reason for the confession. This could be either a type of misdemeanour, or "I just want to talk"

* A text box for details

## Form Behaviour

**When the form is filled in, the confess button becomes enabled.**

What does "filled in" mean, exactly? It's up to you! Perhaps the subject line is required, and the details must be a certain length, and a dropdown option must be selected? Or maybe you think other requirements make more sense - choose some sensible form states that will enable or disable the Confess button!

**When Confess is pressed, if they are confessing to a crime then it should be added to the list of crimes in the current application state. If they just want to talk, you can log their request in the console.**

ðŸ‘‰ Build a form that obeys the above rules, with your own interpretation of what it means for the form to be correctly filled in.

ðŸ‘‰ This might be a good candidate for some testing. (If you haven't been testing all your components already!) Add a `test.js` file to check your button is enabled/disabled correctly given the right props to the form component.

ðŸ‘‰ Check you can submit your own crimes that get added to the list in state!

ðŸ‘‰ (Optional) You may have noticed the 1.5s wait when you call `generateMisdemeanours`. If not, try increasing the sleep(1500) in `generateMisdemeanours` until it becomes annoying when you reload. Can you show a nice "loading" message while the fake API is loading?

(Hint: One way to do this could be to add an `isLoading` boolean to state, for example.)

## Hooray!

You've done it! You've modernised the extremely weird justice system of Fakelandia, and hopefully had some fun and got to experiment a little in the process.

Have a well-deserved rest and look forward to using all these skills to make some extremely cool apps!
